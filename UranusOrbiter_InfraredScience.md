# Uranus Orbiter:  Thermal Infrared Science Objectives

The [Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP)](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/meetings/nov2022/presentations/0815_Simon_V2.pdf) has been recommended as a top-priority mission for the decade 2023-2032 by the US Decadal Survey in Planetary Science.  

The Uranian System provides an exceptional challenge for thermal-infrared science, where the low-temperature environments revealed by Voyager 2 present a significant problem for Earth-based observations. Over the past two decades, ground-based mid-IR (13-25 µm) imaging from observatories like VLT have begun to reveal the spatial structure of Uranus’ atmospheric temperatures and ring emission; while space-based observatories like Spitzer provided disc-averaged spectroscopy to reveal their chemical composition.  This will soon be supplemented by new spatially resolved spectral maps of Uranus’ atmosphere and rings with JWST in the 5-28 µm range, but mid-IR spatial resolution remains poor for the Uranian system due to the 6.5-m JWST mirror: discrete thermal signatures of Uranian clouds cannot be observed; individual Uranian rings cannot be separated; Uranian satellites remain point sources; and we can never contrast the dayside conditions with those of polar winter. 

Thermal-infrared spectroscopy (or imaging) will provide essential scientific contributions to a future mission to an Ice Giant, including (but not limited to) the following science objectives:

1.	**Measure Uranus’ global energy budget (and its time variability) as a constraint on interior structure and evolution:** Uranus' apparently negligible internal heat source is a long-standing mystery with implications for internal layering and the efficiency of cooling since formation.  Precise measurements of the energy balance requires global broadband measurements of thermal emission (summer and winter hemispheres), particularly in the 20-200 µm domain covering the peak Planck emission, to balance reflected sunlight (measured at visible/near-IR over multiple phase angles).  Either filtered imaging or far-IR spectroscopy could accomplish this.

1.	**Measure satellite endogenic thermal emission and thermal inertia:** Detection of anomalous temperatures on Uranus' classical moons (analogous to Enceladus’ vents) would have implications for the properties of Uranian ocean worlds, suggesting geophysical activity and potential connections between icy crusts and deep internal oceans.  Thermal inertia measurements provide estimates of the porosity, strength, and thickness of icy crusts, as well as surface alteration by magnetospheric plasma bombardment: requires broadband thermal mapping of satellite surfaces.

1.	**Map Uranus’ global temperatures and circulation patterns:** This requires spatial resolutions exceeding the scale of Uranian banding in summer and winter hemispheres, to derive global temperature variations in the troposphere, stratospehre and thermosphere and reveal the 3D atmospheric structure.  Temperatures can be used to assess atmospheric stability to convection (e.g., via lapse rates), vertical wind shears (and vorticity gradients in 3D), and the sense and magnitude of large-scale circulation patterns.  Filtered radiometry of the hydrogen-helium continuum (> 17 µm, and 9-10 µm for 1-bar temperatures), hydrogen quadrupoles (requires spectroscopy), or key hydrocarbon emission features (methane 7.7 µm, ethane 12.3 µm, acetylene 13.7 µm) are required to map these temperatures.

1. **Map the distribution of gasesous species as tracers of circulation and chemistry:** Thermal-IR spectroscopy would be needed to separate temperatures from gaseous trace species (e.g., hydrocarbons, externally-supplied oxygen, etc).  Volatile species (e.g., methane and H2S), stratospheric hydrocarbons (ethane and acetylene), and externally-sources species (e.g., water) could all be mapped via mid-IR spectroscopy.  The spatial distribution of para-hydrogen could be mapped using the shape of the hydrogen-helium continuum longward of 17 µm. 

1.	**Understand atmospheric convective processes:** requires thermal, aerosol, and chemical maps at spatial resolutions at the scale of individual storms and vortices. 

1.	**Understand environmental conditions at probe entry location(s):** requires contextual observations of temperatures, aerosols, para-H2, and chemical abundances from IR spectroscopy.	

1.	**Measure magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling:** requires mapping of upper atmospheric heating and its temporal variability (e.g., auroras) using high-resolution spectroscopy of emission lines.

1.	**Determine Uranus’ bulk chemical composition** as a constraint on planetary formation: requires elemental abundances and isotopic ratios derived from mid-IR spectra.

1.	**Measure thermophysical properties of dust in the rings**, as well as constraints on the crystallinity/impurity of ices: requires high-resolution IR spectroscopy from multiple angles.
